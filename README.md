**Intro section with dropdown navigation**
This challenge will test your ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites.
It will also provide some nice basic layout challenges.

**Here are some challenges you may have faced while implementing the design:  **

1. ***Navigation Alignment*** – Initially, the navigation items ("Features," "Company," etc.) were positioned incorrectly, appearing after "Snap" instead of before it. You needed to adjust the flex positioning.  

2. ***Dropdown Functionality*** – Ensuring that dropdown menus appear correctly when hovered or clicked while maintaining a clean layout.  

3. ***Text Color and Styling*** – The navigation text color was not initially black, requiring specific CSS styling.  

4. ***Responsive Design*** – The layout needed adjustments to look good on different screen sizes, especially for mobile views.  

5. ***Button Placement*** – Ensuring that the "Login" and "Register" buttons remain properly aligned while keeping the design aesthetic consistent.
